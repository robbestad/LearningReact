# Component Life Cycle 

When creating a component class by invoking React.createClass(), you should provide a specification object that contains a render method and can optionally contain other lifecycle methods described here

## Initial Render

These are the methods that are available in the initial render of your component.

### Get Initial State
Sets initial value of this.state

      getInitialState: function () {
        return {
            key: "value"
        };
    },


### Get Default Props
Sets initial value of this.props

### Component Will Mount
Calling setState here does not cause a re-render
You cannot call setProps here because setProps can only be set on a mounted component.

### Render
Returns JSX for component
Never update state here

### Component Will Mount
Called immediately after render


## On props change

### Component will receive props
Not called for initial render
- Takes nextprops as input
- Previous props available 
as this.props
- Calling setState() here does
not trigger re-render

### Should component update
Not called for initial render
Can abort render if you
return false here. If false,
componentWillUpdate and 
componentDidUpdate will not
be called.
