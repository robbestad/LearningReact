# React

## React gives you

A lightweight virtual DOM

Powerful views without templates

Unidirectional data flow

Explicit mutation

## Reusable components
Components makes code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.


## Not just the V
From the beginning, React was presented as the V in MVC. 

This is at best a huge simplification. 

React has state, it handles mapping from input to state changes, and it renders components. In this sense, it does everything that an MVC does.
